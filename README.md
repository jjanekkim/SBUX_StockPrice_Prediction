## Introduction

This project is dedicated to constructing a stock price prediction modelâ€”a challenging task due to the multifaceted influences impacting stock prices. The focus here is on developing a short-term prediction model utilizing the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) technique.

## General Info

In this project, I utilized the free Yahoo Finance API to collect historical stock price data for Starbucks. Focusing on a three-month window, I delved into the dataset and discovered a significant surge in stock prices during early November 2023. This surge coincided with Starbucks reporting a considerable revenue increase. However, the stock price gradually declined from mid-November onwards.

To assess the dataset's stationarity, I employed the Dickey-Fuller Test. Additionally, I used autocorrelation (AR/p) and partial autocorrelation (MA/q) to narrow down the parameter range for the ARIMA model. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for the optimal model was calculated at 0.84 cents.
